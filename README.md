# FishEdit
A POSS Fish Game Map Editor For Desktops

# Why POSS?
To protect Fish Game, some parts are not Open Source and are instead precompiled libraries with built in limits to stop abuse. Only `libfgm.dll` and `libfgm.dylib` follow this. An experimental linux varient named `libfgm.so` may also be included in the source, but is currently not used for official releases.
